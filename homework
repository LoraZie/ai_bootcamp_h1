# TITLE Magnit Global and the data Ocean for pay intelligence 

## Overview and Origin Magnit Global is a contingent workforce consulting company. A pioneer in the industry, it began in 1991 with PrO Unlimited as a professional payrolling and compliance organization. It has since evolved to include multiple acquisitions of like companies and relevant software platforms. As of 2024, it employs 3700 people globally and is focused on leveraging both software as a service and the managed services component for contingent workforce on behalf of Fortune 1000 organizations. Magnit has leveraged AI components for many years but is focused on harnessing the strategy that AI can bring to our customers. For purposes of this paper, I am focusing on pay intelligence which can be reaped from the broader data ocean. 
* Name of company Magnit Global

* When was the company incorporated? 1991

* Who are the founders of the company? Original founder was Andy Schultz

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about? I’ve worked here for 19 years and have seen it change rapidly. With the technology that is available now for this industry, I know we are on the precipice of major revolution. In the last two years, we’ve invested millions of dollars to expand our data ocean to enable: skills based hiring, near-time global salary intelligence, statistics across clients, hiring trends, covid trends, etc. It is all data, data, data and now we are speeding to give predictive insights vs. reporting on past metrics. 

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received? 
We are backed by a private equity company. While it is not published how much money has been put into the organization, we acquired two major competitors in 2022 and three data tools in the last three years. 

## Business Activities Magnit Global provides staffing, compliance and payroll solutions on a global scale. This is a business sector that is poised for much reinvigoration due to AI abilities. Specifically for this assignment, my focus is on the company-wide effort to leverage the data ocean for pay rate intelligence that is near time.
* What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve? Magnit is seeking to consume nearly a billion data points across three software platforms to create a strategic platform providing pay rate intelligence based on skill set key words. 

* Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers? Magnit supports a wide variety of customers across business verticals. This includes: Life sciences, Finance, Tech and healthcare. The commonality across all of these clients is that they have a significant footprint of contingent workforce volume necessitating pro-active information, including the pay intelligence referenced above.

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?) The competitive advantage specifically on pay intelligence is the acquisition of People Ticker (SaaS tool that gives global pay intelligence in the contingent space) and our dedicated data scientist team. 

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing&mdash;you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)
Three technology sources that are coming into play: 1. The Vendor Management system (VMS) Wand which is legacy PRO Unlimited and boasts over 400 clients and the historical rates 2. VMS for legacy Workforce Logic (WFQ) which encapsulates data points across 200 clients and 3. People Ticker – a recently acquired company and tech that is VMS and customer agnostic and provides intelligence on pay rates globally.

## Landscape

* What field is the company in?
Contingent workforce solutions and software as a service.
* What have been the major trends and innovations of this field over the last 5&ndash;10 years?
This field has been in a maturation phase over the last decade. Historically, companies would partner directly with a staffing firm, but as the cost of contingent workforce (and all non-FTE populations) have sky rocketed as a major financial investment in every organization, more companies seek a holistic solution in an MSP (Managed Services Provider) and a VMS. The last decade has led to a number of systems that touch the contingent workforce population but don’t necessarily “play well” together. This causes a glut of administrative and reactive work without giving enough pro-active value. In the last 12 months specifically, we have seen the impact of the global pandemic coupled with the ability to “find talent where they are” (meaning not everyone needs to sit in a brick and mortar) and it is escalating the need for real-time data and strategy to find the right skill set at a competitive price. Hence, my focus on the pay rate intelligence.

* What are the other major companies in this field?
From a strictly tech perspective, competitors include Beeline and Fieldglass (owned by SAP). A new competitor in the market as of 18 months ago is VNDLY – this is tech owned by Workday and signifies a tremendous threat to our organization. Many of our clients, especially those in the tech space, have Workday as their FTE solution. VNDLY’s introduction in the market place is enticing to customers who want a “one stop shop” for the entirety of their workforce ecosystem.
## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?
Magnit Global manages $5B in billings every year. We have solutioned workforce designs on behalf of 600 clients and manage the cradle to grave of all CWF needs. The impacts our clients realize is a faster time to fill on average by ten days, cost savings of 10% on total spend in first year and an ability to have unique sourcing channels.
* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this field use to measure success? How is your company performing based on these metrics?

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same field?
We are performing within industry norms. Across this industry, there was a decline in hiring across all customers and therefore a dip in spend. Per Staffing Industry Analysts (SIA) the average dip in revenue in 2023 was 10%. Magnit experienced an 11% dip in revenue in 2023. 
## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
There are so many systems that we have access to yet aren’t able to get the information to “play nice” to then provide informational and actionable insights to our customers. We are still figuring out how to get the three techs listed above to play in the sandbox together, and this is a critical need. Today the efforts are all done via manual intervention which isn’t fast enough. My “dream” for this industry is we can get not only pay intelligence but client trending from the systems. This would be huge – my tech clients always ask “what are you seeing in a trend from your other tech clients? Are we behind? Ahead?” and my life sciences clients ask, “What other suppliers are best suited for our newest clinical trials?” Today, I have to ask a dozen people internally for this information and share more anecdotal insights. What this solution could do is to enable the right coders to focus on getting information from their system to then marry into a more insightful, actionable outcome. I candidly do not know everything that Git can do however, I’m getting dreamy.
* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
Bluntly put, I am seeing AI already disrupt our industry more than anything else that I’ve witnessed in my 23 years in this industry. The good head hunters are using AI to mine key skill sets that they match to job descriptions. Every competitor in the space is scrambling to come up with the big “disruptor” in AI that puts them ahead. By harnessing the three systems we have already, it will be a significant competitive edge. The reality is, we need to act quickly because every competitor is eying how they can enter the AI solution first. Realistically, AI has been part of this industry for years but in more of a reactive state vs. customer centric. 
* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
As I’m merely one week into this bootcamp, I can’t answer this question. I’m certain we would want to somehow incorporate a chat bot to answer quick hit pay intelligence questions, but from the strategy side of the house we would need a nice looking front end tool to display the results. Again, I’m too new to this world to know what that would be.

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution? See my above response. In all fairness, I do not have enough knowledge in the tech stacks out there to answer this in a concrete manner.
